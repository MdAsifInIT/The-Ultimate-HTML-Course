<!-- Creating a page like this is necessary for SEO and also for our page to get indexed on priority -->
<!-- 
We can put any content inside an anchor tag (images, headings etc are all allowed). 

 
If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct page 
(Same applies to img tag as well.) -->

<!-- href can have link to a file on the server or any other link. It can also be used to make the images clickable. -->
